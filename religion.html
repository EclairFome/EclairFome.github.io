                    <p class="text-muted"><img src="assets/img/clipboard-image-1.png" style="width: 433px;"><br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Before I even start, I throw lots of shade to certain religions based on personal experience, studies, history, holy books and current practitioners of said religions. I in NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM MEAN TO OFFEND ANYONE and being part of these religions doesn't make you guilty of the things people did or do in its name, that said... lets begin.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgba(45, 44, 56, 0);">Born into a catholic family, I didn't have much choice but to participate in religious events, enrol on a catholic school and generally just live the default catholic life.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgba(45, 44, 56, 0);">However, I always knew it wasn't for me, at least ever since I had enough braincells to think for myself and question things, not to mention how as a kid when I learned about how christianity expanded in history class, I legit kept asking myself why would people still practice a religion that grew by forcing people to convert and murdered, raped, colonized, etc... all in the name of their God, like hell, I'm panamanian, christianity reached us through the spaniards who colonized us and did all sorts of atrocities&nbsp;here, the same as with the rest of Latin America.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgba(45, 44, 56, 0);">Soon enough I got into theology, read soooo much about christianity and even more about other religions.&nbsp;After hoping around, judaism clicked with me, specifically reform judaism and conservative judaism, but to not make the tale long, even after going as far as learning a fair share of hebrew and studying judaism on and off for around 3-4 years, I eventually realized that although current judaism can be quite progressive and uphold the same valued I already had, the atrocities stated in the Torah/Old testament were still there. From saying that if a man rapes a woman, he is obligated marry her and cant divorce her (Deuteronomy 22:28-29) to the approval of slavery in many verses like for example in&nbsp;Exodus 21:7-11, I was sure that despite me liking the jewish way of life, current values, traditions and so much more, this was a huge deal breaker and I didn't&nbsp;want anything to do with this.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Religion is... complicated, it isn't&nbsp;inheritely bad but all throughout history and unsurprisingly even to this day, so much pain and suffering is caused by it. But to be fair its normally islam and christianity that "stain" the general view of religion, since these 2 are the ones that expanded by force and caused wars, a lot of minor religions don't&nbsp;have a violent history but are still put in the same bag.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">A "funny" example I always take with me is that in Islam, similar to the other Abrahamic&nbsp;religions, homosexuality is considered a sin, and to this day LGBT+ individuals have to fear for their lives in muslim countries due to laws that would get them a prison or death sentence just for existing... Ah, but prophet Muhammad had 12 wifes, one of which was a child he married when she was just 6 years old and he was 53. So really, I now ask you dear reader... in what world does it make sense to practice a religion where the most important figure married a literal child whilst also saying that 2 consenting adults getting together is wrong and should be punished...? I think even the most homophobic, ignorant and bigoted person on this planet can agree that pedophilia is 100 times "worse" than homosexuality.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Anyways, what about currently? Well... I'm&nbsp;a proud agnostic theist that still loves theology and has no plans on coming near organized religion ever again! I deeply believe that some sort of higher power exists or existed, even if they just created the first atom and&nbsp;disappeared, but its not like none of us can know for sure until we die... if there's even anything after physical&nbsp;death that is.</span><br><br></p>
